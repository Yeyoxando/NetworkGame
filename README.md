# NetworkGame
Repository for the AGCP 3rd project.
<br>This project aims to implement a network based-game.

### External own code
Part of a 2D engine did on SDL in 2018 has been implemented to focus on the game and network aspects. Another AI project done in 2020 has also been added to manage all the units behaviour, also to not waste time in implementing this from scratch.
Both of these implemented projects were done by me as college modules' projects in ESAT Valencia.
<br>
<br>All the network, multi-threading and game logic code has been done specifically for this university project.

### External code
ImGUI for UI
<br>GLM for mathemathics
