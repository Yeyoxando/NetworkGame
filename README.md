# NetworkGame
Repository for the AGCP 3rd project.
This project aims to implement a network based-game.

### Reused code
Part of a 2D engine did on SDL in 2018 has been implemented to focus on the game and network aspects. Another AI project done in 2020 has also been added to manage all the units behaviour, also to not waste time in implementing this from scratch.
All the network, multi-threading and game logic code has been done specifically for this university project.
